## Seasons



## Annual Holidays

**The Feast of Voices** - 

**Tome Day** - A grand book and scroll fair where people get together and have contests of words. It is an homage to the Renaissance of prose, where it is legend that all of the world’s greatest writers were suddenly struck with inspiration.

**The Sacrament of the Luminous Lords**

**The Fair of Flames**

**Starfall**

**The Eve of the Rose**

**The Solstice**

**Lantern's Rise** - The cultural event of contests of plays, and light and illusions. This has become tradition from long ago, before written history was a thing. All history was passed down via stories, or even play-like things being acted out.

**Propitiation of the Twins** – around twenty years ago a pair of shooting stars appeared in the night sky. Soothsayers and astrologers predicted that this would usher in a new age of prosperity. People began leaving offerings in public squares to entice “the Twins” to bless their household. Now, every year on the anniversary, people have continued the tradition by lighting two candles and leaving a small bread cake in a public area at dusk.


**Bell Day**

**Twilight Moot**

**Weaver’s Eve** – An artful festival for fabric makers. Celebrates the day when the nearby forest’s local spider population came to the townspeople asking for help to safeguard their nests from foraging cockatrices. The local seamstresses responded by making large, sturdy fabric webs for the spiders to hide in until the cockatrices could be dealt with.

**Last Tidings** – It is said there once was a witchy lass who fell in love with a sailor. He went to sea and for twenty five years she would wait for him at the sea cliff until the last tide went out at dusk. On the final night of her vigil on the last outgoing tide of the year she received word that her lover had perished. She cursed and vowed to the heavens that nobody would ever have to suffer and wait as long as she did for closure. She performed some unknown ritual and ever since that night, on the last out going tide of the last day of the year, anybody who whispers the name of a loved one on the seaside cliff will either hear the name returned meaning they were still alive or hear the cry of an albatross and know them perished. Two night long festivals have arisen one mourning the other joyous as lovers learn the truth. It is no coincidence that many of the single participants find comfort and more in each other’s company.
