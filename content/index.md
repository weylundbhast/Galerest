Galerest is a land of miracles and quests.  Heroes and Villains alike perform great deeds for the favor of dead gods and dormant spirits.  People quest for adventure, love, riches and relics left behind from a bygone era.

The Lands of Galerest are populated by a myriad a beings.  Though myth and fables lend stories to the origins of individual heritages in Galerest, time marches on. While some bastions to those origins may be found throughout the world, the populations are equally as unique as they are diverse.

The [Greater Beings](content/Cosmos/Greater%20Beings.md) of Galerest created many beings in the formation of the world.  Humans, Elves, Dwarves, Halflings, Gnomes and Orcs were formed as new beings, while other heritages were brought about through the manipulation of beasts by ancient powers.

While [[Heritage]] differentiates between the peoples of Galerest, it does not define their morality or ability.

## Continents

### [[Imeron]]

Imeron is dominated by the [[Vethor Monarchy]].  A society steeped in the traditions of the monarchy, and deeply held beliefs in the powers of the Gods.  The north is ruled by the [[Athela Council]], who have splintered away from the monarchy over a dispute of the true status of the Gods.

East of the Mountains sits the location of [[The Seat of the Gods]], a holy site that is believed to be the final resting place of the Gods. 
### [[Velenar]]

Scarred by [The Titanic Wars](content/History/The%20Titanic%20Wars.md), the majority of Velenar is a barren landscape populated with small outposts of lush civilization that have flourished in the few habitable areas.  These population centers are generally referred to as the [[Alliance of Free Cities]].


### [[Edrim]]

Edrim is a diverse landscape populated by a large variation of societies, many of which follow the old ways, rejecting the modern pantheon and remained loyal to the elemental forces.  No single power controls Edrim, and instead it is governed by a collection of city states each with ties to druidic traditions and worship of the elemental powers.  Edrim is filled with wild place, and unusual magic bleeds into the material plane.

### [[Kalas]]

The Kalas Islands are a wide ranging archipelago populated by two opposing forces.  The [[Toria Trade Company]] is set on claiming resources within the archipelago and has set up outposts to facilitate their activities.  The [[Siren Song Confederacy]] raids the islands, battling against the restrictions of their freedoms.
